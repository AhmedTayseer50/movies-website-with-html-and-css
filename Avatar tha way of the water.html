                    a 2022 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by James Cameron. He co-wrote the
                    screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver from a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and
                    Shane Salerno. Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second
                    installment in the Avatar film series. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Salda√±a, Stephen Lang, Joel
                    David Moore, CCH Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the
                    original film, with Sigourney Weaver returning in an additional role.[6] New cast members include
                    Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, and Jemaine Clement. In the film, Na'vi Jake Sully
                    (Worthington) and his family, under renewed human threat, seek refuge with the Metkayina clan of
                    Pandora.
